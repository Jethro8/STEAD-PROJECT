      <h1>MODEL 1</h1>
      <p>After a comprehensive evaluation of the model, it can be established that water content is inversely related to bulk density, suggesting that as water content increases, bulk density decreases. Water content is also proportional to Specific Volume, Porosity, Void ratio, and Saturation ratio, in contrast to bulk density, meaning that as water content rises, so do these qualities.</p>

    <div class="box-2">
      <h1>MODEL 2</h1>
      <p>The model's dry density rises as the bulk density rises, indicating that the two values are proportionate. The bulk density, on the other hand, has an inverse relationship with the Specific Volume, Porosity, Void ratio, and Saturation ratio, indicating that as the bulk density rises, these parameters decline.</p>
